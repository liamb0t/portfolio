# Creating a Soccer Highlights Website Using Vue, Flask and Reddit API

I love football (soccer for the non-British folk) and r/soccer is pretty much the go to place for finding highlights at least for me. But wouldn't it be nice if there was a place you go to that displayed all the highlights and nothing but highlights? With no deadlinks or copy-striked content? That is what I wanted to create with this web app! I'd been mulling over the idea for a while and wish I'd actually made it before Reddit introduced its new API pricing rules. Perfect timing, I know. Nevertheless, I needed a project to practice my Vue skills so who cares about the API pricing rules, right? If people want to use the app, it's available on Github!
